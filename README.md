Here's a quick demo video of what it's all about [https://youtu.be/DaK4d4Belwk](https://youtu.be/DaK4d4Belwk)

## What is decenthost?
Simply put, decenthost is a way to serve a website to the internet from any local computer where you install decentclient.

You keep all the files on your local computer and pick the subdomain where the website lives: (https://{yourApp}.decenthost.io).

## Getting started
Download the website client installer from this page and install it on your computer (currently windows only sorry). 

IMPORTANT, You will need to unblock the setup.exe once downloaded or it will not run.

Pick a location to install decenthost and once installed, run the .exe through a command prompt. 
This will assign you a random decenthost url and run the default website from your computer.
